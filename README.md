### Project Description
A quirky web app that takes a photo of your palm, ‚Äúscans‚Äù it with funny animations, and then predicts your future in Malayalam ‚Äî mixing good and bad luck with hilarious, random dates!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who really needs real palm reading when you can have a totally random and entertaining ‚Äúfuture prediction‚Äù generator that‚Äôs equally believable and ridiculous?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload a picture of your palm, watch the scanner mock your life choices, and then get 7 unique, meme-worthy predictions about your future ‚Äî all with dates that make at least some sense. Perfect for laughs and weird fun!

*This flowchart illustrates a simplified workflow for a palm reader application. The process begins with the user uploading an image of their palm. The app then displays the image and shows a scanning animation for a fun, engaging user experience. Following this, the app randomly generates pre-defined predictions. Finally, the generated predictions are displayed to the user*
